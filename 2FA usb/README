This Powershell script enables you to carry around a Powershell VeraCrypt encrypted container mounting USB
This Uses a Veracrypted file, named huh.txt on root of unecrypted device you can change the name of this to any thing
Also a keyfile is present on root of unecrypted device named id_rsa.pub

The Keyfiles are User specfic, The current script check for a key folder structure and a key file
Key folder struc = C:\.catsyndrome\chrome\storage\cache\browser\history\huh
key file = C:\.catsyndrome\chrome\storage\cache\browser\history\huh\id_rsa.pub

The script currently creates these folders and copys the id_rsa.pub file to the folder specfied in scirpt, Change this
to what ever you want.

After mount of decrpted veracrypt, script kills chrome process, Dels profile 1 Under current user appdata
Then copies X:\ChromeData\Profile 1 to the appdata chrome folder, Under my X:\ i have a shortcut that starts chrome with the newly copied 
chrome profile 1.

After this you get a prompt to press enter, Doing so will unmount the drive, Copy the current chrome profile 1 to the X:/ then 
Remove any traces of chrome appdata folder


*****In case you dont know just create a chrome shortcut with a tartget profile then edit the target as such.
Shortcut Tartget = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --profile-directory="Profile 1"

Please replace otp HASH with your pin hash, The script checks if your pin hash matches what is setup. and then develops a TOTP using this
pin, python script included to calulate the TOTP on your phone or any computer. Pretty much taking this completey offline

SEC ISSUES: Someone could easily Change the pin hash to equal what ever and then just calulate the TOTP just from reading the script, 
this is more of a obsecurity technique, they would still need the first password to even unlock the encrypted storage

Solution: **In progress: Create TOTP Using own server api, (Only issue with this is a MITM attack Solutions are VPN, strong localnet, 
security though obsecurity making the server return garbage and script decodes)


Using Google Authenticator TOTP = https://dan.hersam.com/tools/gen-qr-code.html

IDEA* Using hashes as a keyfile or a password for encyrpted file, Ex. HASH of a webpage, Hash of a private key, Hash of a second password, 
IDEA* Using 2 Factor Auth to unlock, Would have to use somthing very simple,  Google Authenticator OTP, that corrolates with a privatekey
to the current time or some known var to create a OTP, Implementing some short algo.



I will make everything more user friendly when i complete this project
